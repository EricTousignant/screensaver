<h1>The Photo Screen Saver Extension Has Been Updated</h1>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<h2>There have been some significant changes in this&nbsp;version:</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <h3>The API that is used to Access your Google Photos has changed.</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Your currently selected Albums have been removed. You will need to reselect&nbsp; them.</li>
      <li>You will be prompted to allow the Google Photo&#39;s API to access you Google Photos.You need to allow this.</li>
      <li>If you are having problems accessing your photos, exit Chrome from the menu. Do not just click on the 'X', and try again.</li>
      <li>If you are still having problems, please uninstall and reinstall the extension.</li>
      <li>There is now a limit to the number of API calls the extension can make per day. If this happens, uncached photos will not be displayed and you will not be able to change your photo selections. The quote is reset at midnight Pacific time daily.</li>
      <li>Location information is no longer available from the API</li>
      <li>You can now click on one of your photo&#39;s to display it in Google Photos</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <h3>Other changes</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>The code has been completely rewritten to support changes coming soon to Chrome. I have tested it, but there may be some issues. If so, please contact me from the "Help and Feedback" page.</li>
      <li>Google has limited their GEO Location API. Location information of photos is currently not available.</li>
      <li>The time selection for the Keep Awake has been simplified</li>
    </ul>
