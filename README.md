## Photo Screen Saver Chrome Extension

This extension displays a screensaver composed of a slide show of photos from multiple sources. Supported photo sources include:

* Your Google Photos and Albums - Note: Shared Albums are not supported
* Some background photos used by Chromecast

* Interesting photos from Flickr

Note: Photos from the local file system are not supported.

Many options are available to control the appearance of the slide show, including:

* Wait time after machine becomes idle to display screensaver
* Between photo time interval
* Photo display mode - (e.g., letterbox, fill screen)
* Photo transition animations - (e.g., fade, scale up)
* A scheduler to control when the screensaver, display, and computer should remain on
* Do not display over full screen Chrome windows (e.g., YouTube, Netflix)
* Show on all displays
