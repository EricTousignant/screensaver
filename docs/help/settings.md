Allows Chrome to startup when you log into your computer and continue to run (invisibly),
even if you close all its windows.
This will allow the extension to display the screensaver when necessary.
If you use the "Exit" command from the main Chrome menu, Chrome will
not run in the background until the next time you start it or log in to the computer.

This has no effect on Chrome OS, because Chrome always runs in the background.

There is also a global setting in Chrome that needs to be enabled for this to work.
Open the Chrome settings [chrome://settings], click on "Advanced", scroll to "System"
and make sure the setting is enabled:

Allows you to pause and scroll through the screensaver manually. The following 
keyboard combinations are available:

* Alt++Shift+Space Bar - Toggle the slide show between paused and running.
* Alt+Shift+Right Arrow - Move forward one slide.
* Alt+Shift+Left Arrow - Move backward one slide.

You can change the key mappings that are used for this in Chrome. Open the extension
shortcuts page [chrome://extensions/shortcuts] scroll to "Photo Screen Saver"
and change the individual commands.  Don't actually type in the text for a command,
just place the cursor in the command you want to change and press the key combination
you want to use.
