When you select an album, information about each photo will be retrieved 
from your Google Photos account. This can be a lengthy operation. If you
have added or removed photos from an album in Google Photos and wish that
to be reflected in the extension, you can deselect then reselect the album.
The extension does automatically update the contents daily.

The count for unselected albums is the total number of items in the album.
The count for selected albums is the actual number of photos the extension has
retrieved. This will differ from total count if there are videos in the
album or there are more than the maximum allowable photos per album.
